  <h1>About Me</h1>
I am a college student at the University of Miami.
I have great experience working, cooperating, and interacting with other people because of my sports background.
I enjoy the feeling, of great pride and joy, after achieving a goal while working with other people.
Knowing someone has your back is a great feeling, but the part I enjoy the most is knowing someone else trust me to have their back.
Regadless of weather it's on a sporting team, a group project in school, or a task that needs to be performed for work,
working with others has always been, and will always be a great saticfation to me.
This is why coaching was one of my favorite jobs.
When My decision will affect 15-20 other people, and those people trust, lissen, and respect my decision, it is a great feeling.
In addition, when that decision works, and I can see the enjoyment my players gets from a basehit, winning the game, or just being part of a team,
it makes me realize that the greatest enjoyment one can get is when they share that enjoyment with others.
