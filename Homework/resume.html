      <h2>About Me</h2>
      I am a college student at the University of Miami. I have great experience working, cooperating, and interacting with other people because of my sports background. I enjoy the feeling, of great pride and joy, after achieving a goal while working with other people. Knowing someone has your back is a great feeling, but the part I enjoy the most is knowing someone else trust me to have their back. Regadless of weather it's on a sporting team, a group project in school, or a task that needs to be performed for work, working with others has always been, and will always be a great saticfation to me. This is why coaching was one of my favorite jobs. When My decision will affect 15-20 other people, and those people trust, listen to, and respect my decision, it is a great feeling. In addition, when that decision works, and I can see the enjoyment my players gets from a basehit, winning the game, or just being part of a team, it makes me realize that the greatest enjoyment one can get is when they share that enjoyment with others.
